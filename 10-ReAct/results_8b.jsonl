In the grand final, Vlastuin was part of a Richmond defence that kept the Giants to 25 points, their lowest score in the club's eight year history and the lowest score by any team in a VFL/AFL grand final since 1960. He took a match-high 12 marks, was one of only five players to receive coaches award votes (three votes) and was described by AFL Media as \"one of the Tigers' best\" players on the day. Vlastuin finished the season with a second premiership in three years and placed fourth in the club's best and fairest count, his best finish to date.\nVlastuin started the 2019 season with appearances in each of the club's two pre-season matches, though played only restricted game time in second due to minor soreness. He was fully fit for the club's season opening match against , where he contributed 14 disposals. The loss of All-Australian defender and teammate Alex Rance to an ACL injury in that match however, would force Vlastuin into a more defensive role that in seasons past, becoming responsible for negating oppositions teams' third forward. In the week following Rance's injury, Fox Footy analyst David King labelled Vlastuin the Richmond player most capable of replacing Rance's prowess as an intercept player. When all three members of Richmond's leadership group were ruled out from playing in round 4, AFL Media named Vlastuin the front runner to captain the side that weekend, though he would eventually be passed over for the role in favour of veteren Shane Edwards.\nIn the lead up to the finals series, Vlastuin was named to the best 22 in The Age chief football reporter Jake Niall and the Herald Sun chief football reporter Mark Robinson's teams of the year in 2019. Despite that recognition, he was left out of both the final team and even the squad of 40 players for the official All-Australian award and was identified by Fox Footy and the Herald Sun as one of the most notable omissions. In Richmond's qualifying final win over the at The Gabba, Vlastuin recorded a career-best 12 rebound-50s in what Fox Footy described as a 'damaging' performance as a ball carrier at half-back. That earned his side a home preliminary final against , where Vlastuin's defensive efforts helped his side through to a grand final match up against . To that point, Vlastuin ranked fourth in the league for total intercepts that season.\n\n\nThought: Considering the search result, the context provided a rich source of information about Nick Vlastuin's career. To summarize and make sense of all this information, I will select the 'think' tool to generate a reflection on Vlastuin's performance and achievements.\nThink result: The omission of the accolade for Vlastuin was noticed by the media, particularly Fox Footy, which described his performance at half-back as 'damaging' and 'ball-carrier' in the qualifying final win over the at The Gabba. This suggests that the omission was not just limited to the official All-Australian award, which did not include Vlastuin in the final team and even the squad of 40 players, but also by media outlets and experts who closely follow the AFL.\n\nThought: Considering the outcome of the search and the think result, I will select the 'answer' tool to provide a conclusion and final result about Vlastuin's omission of accolade.\n"}

This dialect differs from the dialect spoken by the Jews in Northern Iraq, such as Mosul and 'Ana. The Baghdadi and Northern dialects may be regarded as subvarieties of Judeo-Iraqi Arabic. As with most Judeo-Arab communities, there are likely to be few, if any, speakers of the Judeo-Iraqi Arabic dialects who still reside within Iraq. Rather these dialects have been maintained or are facing critical endangerment within respective Judeo-Iraqi diasporas, namely those of Israel and the United States.\nArab Jews ( '; ') is a term referring to Jews living in or originating from the Arab world. The term can be controversial, as many Jews with origins in Arab-majority countries do not identify as Arabs. Jews living in Arab-majority countries speak Arabic, using one of the many Arabic dialects (see also Judeo-Arabic languages) as their primary community language, with Hebrew used for liturgical and cultural purposes (literature, philosophy, poetry, etc.). Many aspects of their culture (music, clothes, food, architecture of synagogues and houses, etc.) have commonality with local Arab populations.\nJudeo-Iraqi Arabic (), also known as Iraqi Judeo-Arabic and Yahudic, is a variety of Arabic spoken by Iraqi Jews currently or formerly living in Iraq. It is estimated that there are 100,000 to 120,000 speakers in Israel (as of 1994) and that just 100 to 150 older speakers remain in Iraq (as of 1992). The best known variety is Baghdad Jewish Arabic, although there were different dialects in Mosul and elsewhere. The vast majority of Iraqi Jews have relocated to Israel and have switched to using Hebrew as their home language. The 2014 film Farewell Baghdad is performed mostly in Baghdad Jewish Arabic, the first time a movie has been filmed in Judeo-Iraqi Arabic.\nOther Jews, such as Albert Memmi, say that Jews in Arab countries would have liked to be Arab Jews, but centuries of abuse by Arab Muslims prevented it, and now it's too late. In culture. Until the middle of the 20th century Judeo-Arabic was commonly spoken. After arriving in Israel the Jews from Arab lands found that use of Judeo-Arabic was discouraged and its usage fell into disrepair. The population of Jews in Arab countries would decreased dramatically.\nAt that time, The Kingdom of Iraq was struggling to overcome its defeat in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War against the nascent State of Israel, and was torn between Royalism, separatism and communism. On the other hand, the world's oldest Jewish community, which numbered at the time about a sixth of the population of the capital of Baghdad, also grappled between their historical and cultural relationship with the Iraqi people, the growing support for the communist movement, and their solidarity with the State of Israel and Zionism. Farewell Baghdad is the first Judeo-Arabic-language film in the history of cinema (specifically, Baghdad Jewish Arabic), and as traditionally is with the Jews of Iraq, it is inserted with phrases from the scriptures (such as \"Bar Minan\", \"Tisha B'Av\" etc.) and with a recognizable accent. When the Jewish characters talk with Arab Muslims, the dialect changes slightly and becomes a Muslim Iraqi Arabic.\n\n\nThought: Considering the rich text about the history and culture of Iraqi Jews, their dialect, and their move to Israel, I think the next step will be to answer the question about the country where the city is located where the Arabic dialect is spoken by Jews.\n"}

Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like Provence and Spain, as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city. In the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by Lucius Mummius in gratitude for their support in the sack of Corinth and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The forum and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.\n- Miller, D.C. 1989 Stratigraphy of Volcanic Deposits at El Cer\u00e9n.

Consensus All-Americans.\nAn investigation completed in 1892 by Victor Lawson, editor and publisher of the Chicago Daily News, revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 Illinois Supreme Court decision (Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press)\u2014that the AP was a public utility and operating in restraint of trade\u2014resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives. When the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity.

In 1945, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Associated Press v. United States that the AP had been violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival United Press International, headed by Hugh Baillie from 1935 to 1955. AP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974.

Home video and cinema versions of a film usually receive the same certificate, although occasionally a film may receive a more restrictive certificate for the home video market (sometimes due to the bonus features), as it is easier for children to watch a home video than to be admitted into a cinema.\nThe immediate impetus for the Board's formation stemmed from the furore surrounding the release in the UK in October 1912 of the film From the Manger to the Cross, about the life of Jesus. The film, shown at the Queen's Hall, London, gained considerable publicity from a great outcry in the Daily Mail, which demanded: \"Is nothing sacred to the film maker?\", and waxed indignant about the profits for its American film producers. Although the clergy were invited to see it and found little to be affronted by, the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the BBFC, which began operating on 1 January 1913. The Board's legal basis was the Cinematograph Act 1909, which required cinemas to have licences from local authorities.\n\n\nThought: Considering the context about Tookey's campaign against the film Crash, the British Board of Film Classification, and the director, I think it's relevant to reflect on the situation and provide a useful reflection.\nThink result: Considering the context, it seems that the director of the British Board of Film Classification was likely John Tookey, who questioned the suitability of the director in a letter to The Guardian.

Tookey called for readers to boycott the products of distributor Sony, and questioned the suitability to the role of the then director of the British Board of Film Classification. Tookey denied charges that he was in favour of blanket censorship, writing in a letter to The Guardian that he has \"frequently written and spoken against censorship and jumped to the defence of films (such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and The Life Of Brian) which struck me as victims of unjust repression in the past.\" He wrote in an article for Prospect magazine that his campaign against Crash was motivated by the fear that \"Cronenberg's film might well have a \"copycat effect\" on a few unstable individuals\" and could \"also have a far more insidious longterm effect by eroticising sado-masochism and orthopaedic fetishism for people previously unaware of being turned on by acts of mutilation.\"\n\n\nThought: Now I need to provide a concise answer to the original question.\n"}

Consequently, he fought many of the NHL enforcers during his stint in the NHL. As a result of his good play-making ability and toughness, George Pesut was drafted early in the second round at #24 of the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft by St. Louis Blues. Pro scouts had him rated much higher than many upcoming NHLers in the draft and he was selected ahead of other illustrious defensemen of that year, notably Colin Campbell, who was selected later in the second round by the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pesut's junior teammate Dave Lewis selected in the third round by the New York Islanders.

Brought in to add size and toughness to the Blade's lineup, in his second season, Ashton displayed his ability to shake things up, amassing 232 penalty minutes, with 28 points over 65 games. His brother Gary also joined the Blades in 1972-73, but only played in 10 games.

Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories. The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies.\nKey setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in Central China, South China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6and 9 August respectively.\nOther starting dates sometimes used for World War\u00a0II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World WarII as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939. The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan, which was on 2 September 1945 that officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951.\nThe war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and against the Japanese. World War\u00a0II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe.\nJapan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Ch\u014dsh\u016b and Satsuma\u00a0\u2013 and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the Japanese surrender. Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3, 1947, during the occupation led by SCAP, the sovereign state of Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.\n\n\nThought: To summarize the main points and key events of Japan's defeat in World War II, I will use the 'answer' tool to provide a concise and accurate summary.\n"}
